# How to write a simple library in Haskell

The library we will be building today is called Pythagoras. It is a simple library with functions for solving for a, b, or c using the Pythagorean Theorem.

---
# Prerequisites
- something about math
- Basic understanding of the terminal or command line.

### Goals
- A simple way of performing the Pythagorean Theorem. 
- Make it simple and easy to understand.
- Simple names for functions to minimize confusion.
- Make sure the library can handle floating point numbers because the hypotenuse could be a floating point number. May be tricky

### Steps

1. Create Directory called Pythagoras
2.  ```cd``` Inside your Pythagoras directory and issue the command
    ```haskell
    cabal init
    ```
3. At this point you will be prompted to configure your .cabal package. These are the things you find on the homepage of a hackage library under _Properties_. It looks something along the lines of this:
    ```haskell
	-- Initial Pythagoras.cabal generated by cabal init.  For further 
    -- documentation, see http://haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/
    
    name:                Pythagoras
    version:             0.1.0.0
    synopsis:            A simple library for doing the Pythagorean Theorem.
    homepage:            http://github.com/Cortlandd/Pythagoras
    license:             PublicDomain
    license-file:        LICENSE
    author:              Cortland Walker
    maintainer:          cortlandits@gmail.com
    category:            Math
    build-type:          Simple
    cabal-version:       >=1.10
    
    library
      -- Other library packages from which modules are imported.
      build-depends:       base >=4.8 && <4.9
      
      -- Directories containing source files.
      hs-source-dirs:      src
      
      -- Base language which the package is written in.
      default-language:    Haskell2010
    ```


3.1. In many cases your src would look something like this for a library:
    
```haskell
    src/
        Pythagoras.hs
        Pythagoras
```
with this, the ```Pythagoras/``` folder is where your source code goes, and ```Pythagoras.hs``` is the module file which imports all the source code from ```Pythagoras```. But in our case we will only need 1 file inside of our ```src```.
