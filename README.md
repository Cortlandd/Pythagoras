# Pythagoras
Pythagoras is a small Haskell library for performing the Pythagorean Theorum.

_If you would like to learn how to Pythagoras is built or how to build a small Haskell Library? I made a tutorial. Its under PythagorasTutorial.md_


# Usage
```haskell
Prelude> solveForB 9 _ 15
12
```

---
# Features I hope for.

```haskell
Prelude> solveForB 9 _ 15 --command
a^2 + b^2 = c2
9^2 + b^2 = 152
81 + b^2 = 225
b^2 = 144
b = sqrt 144
b = 12
```
