# Pythagoras
Pythagoras is a small Haskell library for calculating the lengths of a triangle using the PYthagorean Theorem

If you would like to learn how Pythagoras was built or how to build a small Haskell Library? I made a tutorial. It's at the  [PythagorasTutorial.md](PythagorasTutorial.md)


# Usage
```haskell
Prelude> solveForB 9 15
12.0
```

---
# Features I hope to add

```haskell
Prelude> verboseSolveForB 9 15
a^2 + b^2 = c2
9^2 + b^2 = 152
81 + b^2 = 225
b^2 = 144
b = sqrt 144
b = 12
```
